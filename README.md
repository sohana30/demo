# Newsletter Signup Training Project

Build a simple newsletter signup splash page!

Building static pages like this isn't likely to be something we actually do for a real client, however, it's a great way to test your frontend basics while also introducing you to some general tools, methodologies and process that we use every day at Acro Media.

**Skills:** Git, HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Mobile-first, Image optimization, Accessibility, Figma, and more.

## Getting started

2. Move into the cloned project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the packages for compiling your stylesheets.
